# Python Skills Check — Slides 61–116
# CONDITIONALS & FUNCTIONS — CHALLENGE VERSION
# ============================================================

# DIRECTIONS
# ============================================================
# - I recommend you create a repo first and clone it.
# - Drag this file into your repo and push when you are done.
#
# Complete each task underneath its directions.
#
# RULES:
# - Use ONLY concepts we have learned in class.
# - Use the EXACT variable and function names provided.
# - Do not delete the directions.
# - Your entire Python file must run without errors.
# - Do NOT manually type an answer that Python should determine.
# - Pay attention to indentation.
# - Read carefully. MANY questions are intentionally tricky.
# - Unless a task says otherwise, do NOT use min() or max().
# - Your conditions should work even if the variable values are changed.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# Some questions are designed so that the ORDER of your conditions matters.
# Some questions have edge cases such as ties or boundary values.
# Test your logic carefully.

#
# Write a function named:
#
# rps_winner
#
# Parameters:
#
# player1
# player2
#
# Each argument will be:
#
# "rock"
# "paper"
# or
# "scissors"
#
# RETURN:
#
# "tie"
#
# if both players choose the same thing.
#
# RETURN:
#
# "player1"
#
# if player 1 wins.
#
# RETURN:
#
# "player2"
#
# if player 2 wins.
#
# Rules:
#
# rock beats scissors
# scissors beats paper
# paper beats rock
#
# Examples:
#
# rps_winner("rock", "scissors")  -> "player1"
# rps_winner("paper", "rock")     -> "player1"
# rps_winner("rock", "paper")     -> "player2"
# rps_winner("paper", "paper")    -> "tie"
#
# This is a logic problem.
# There are several possible combinations.

# LEETCODE-STYLE TASK 75 — CLOSEST TO 100
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Write a function named:
#
# closest_to_100
#
# Parameters:
#
# a
# b
#
# RETURN whichever number is closer to 100.

#
# -1
#
# Examples:
#
# closest_to_100(90, 80)    -> 90

# closest_to_100(90, 110)   -> -1
#
# RESTRICTION:
# Do NOT use abs().
#
# THINK:
# A number may be above OR below 100.
# You will need to determine each number's distance from 100.

# LEETCODE-STYLE TASK 76 — DELIVERY FEE
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Write a function named:
#
# delivery_fee
#

# RETURN 5
#
# Otherwise:
# RETURN 10
#
# Examples:
#

# delivery_fee(30, 3)  -> 5
# delivery_fee(60, 8)  -> 10
# delivery_fee(30, 8)  -> 10
#
# THINK:
# A large order does NOT always mean free delivery.

# LEETCODE-STYLE TASK 77 — ATM WITHDRAWAL
# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Write a function named:
#
# can_withdraw

#
# - amount is greater than 0
# - amount is less than or equal to balance
# - amount is divisible by 20
#
# RETURN True if the withdrawal is allowed.
# Otherwise RETURN False.
#
# Examples:
#
# can_withdraw(500, 100)  -> True

#
# Write a function named:
#
# battery_status
#
# Parameters:
#
# battery
# is_charging
#
# RETURN:
#
# "critical"
# if battery is 5 or lower AND it is NOT charging
#
# "low"
# if battery is 20 or lower AND it is NOT charging
#
# "charging"
# if is_charging is True
#

#
# taxi_fare
#
# Parameters:
#

#
# Fare rules:
#
# Base fare: $4
# Each mile: $2
#
# If is_night is True, add a $5 night fee.
#
# RETURN the total fare.
#
# Examples:
#
# taxi_fare(0, False)  -> 4
# taxi_fare(5, False)  -> 14
# taxi_fare(5, True)   -> 19
#
# Build the final answer from the rules instead of

# ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Write a function named:
#
# calculate_damage
#
# Parameters:
#
# attack
# defense
# critical
#
# First calculate:
#
# damage = attack - defense
#
# If damage would be less than 0, damage becomes 0.
#
# If critical is True, DOUBLE the damage.
#
# RETURN the final damage.
#
# Examples:
#
# calculate_damage(20, 5, False)  -> 15
# calculate_damage(20, 5, True)   -> 30
# calculate_damage(5, 20, False)  -> 0
# calculate_damage(5, 20, True)   -> 0

# RETURN the FINAL price after the discount.
#
# Examples:
#
# final_price(100, "none")    -> 100
# final_price(100, "SAVE10")  -> 90
# final_price(100, "SAVE25")  -> 75
# final_price(80, "SAVE25")   -> 60
#
# THINK:
# A 25% discount means the customer pays 75% of the price.
